### About:

Project Hedes is a labor of love that I have been refining over the past few years in the form of many different smaller projects, and many unfinished components. This mod's goal is to provide a framework that allows others to easily add dynamic ambiance to their campaigns. There are several features in this release that I feel are complete enough, that players may enjoy trying them with their own campaigns. If you want to help, please test the mod, provide feedback (here or on GitHub), or reach out to me directly!
